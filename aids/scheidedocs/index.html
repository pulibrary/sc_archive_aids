<b>Provenance</b>
<p>The John Hinsdale Scheide Collection was amassed in the years 1890-1941
by William T. Scheide (1847-1907), who had been inspired to collect by
his tour of Italy in 1889, and later by his son John Hinsdale Scheide (1875-1942),
Princeton Class of 1896. William acquired most of the contents of boxes
1-155, focusing on Italian documents though not to the exclusion of representative
examples from England and France; it would appear that almost all of the
Italian material was purchased from the Florentine publisher and antiquarian
book dealer Leo S. Olschki. John, however, was far more interested in French
and English documents, and bought a great deal from the London dealer Maggs
Bros. and at auction. The principal part was acquired at the 8 November
1938 auction (sale no. 61) at Parke-Bernet Galleries in New York. The Slade
Collection was described at the time as "about 2500 Chirographical Specimens
from the XIIth to XIXth Century" from the collection of Lawrence Slade,
who was the son-in-law of the eminent collector Robert Hoe, and had purchased
most of them from the Parisian dealer Charavay in the 1920s. The bulk of
these documents form the extensive papers of the noble D'Olive family of
Toulouse from the 16<sup>th</sup> century until the French Revolution.
<p>The collection was originally housed at the Scheide family home in Titusville,
Pennsylvania. A formal deposit agreement was made in 1938, and the documents
were shipped to Princeton in stages and put on deposit at the Treasure
Book Room of the Moses Taylor Pyne Library. In 1939 a brief inventory was
made of boxes 1-155. An additional 152 documents in boxes 251-263 were
deposited in 1943 by John's son, William H. Scheide, Princeton Class of
1936. In 1945 the latter indicated the family's intention to donate the
Scheide documents to the Library, but formal donation was not made by him
until 1947. The John Hinsdale Scheide Collection was given the accession
number AM 13016 on 16 January 1948.
<p><b>Early Description and Arrangement</b>
<p>The basic arrangement and description of the collection was the work
of Chalfant Robinson (1871-1946), a professor of Classics and Curator of
Medieval History (or Curator of Medieval Manuscripts). The Library had
originally planned to calendar the collection after each item had been
fully identified and arranged by place (diocese) and date, but the plans
were not completed by the time of Robinson's death. Instead, large parts
of the collection were largely kept as received in "letter boxes" organized
by century and country in order to help illustrate the history of European
script and facilitate paleographical study; this scheme sometimes resulted
in discrete series of items retaining the order in which the documents
were found when purchased. Robinson provided descriptions for approximately
224 of the 263 boxes of the documents. The remaining documents were described
by successive manuscript curators of Princeton, including Jean F. Preston
and Don C. Skemer.
<p>The Fabriano Documents were described by J. Melvin Edelstein (b. 1924),
when he was at John Hopkins University. Fifteen documents from this collection,
including a Fabriano document from 999, had been retained by The Scheide
Library before the collection was donated and are now described in the
Princeton University Library online catalog. The Lawrence Slade Collection
(boxes 165-194) was described in 1992-1993 by Leslie Tuttle, a graduate
student in the History Department.
<p>During 2002-2003, Sharon Strulowitz integrated the various sources of
descriptive information about the documents in the collection into a Microsoft
Access database. A printout from that database, listing the documents by
country (then place name and date), constitutes the present finding aid.
<p>Researchers will note that a small number of items have been omitted
from this listing. These items, primarily textual material, are described
in the catalog of Medieval and Renaissance manuscripts in the Princeton
University Library. For further questions on these materials please consult
Don C. Skemer, Curator of Manuscripts.

<h3>
<a NAME="scope"></a><b>Scope and Contents</b></h3>
More than half of the 7,935 items in the Scheide collection are Italian
notarial documents from the Middle Ages and Renaissance, the bulk of them
dating from about 1200 to 1650. The documents include wills, dowers, pious
donations to churches, leases, business contracts, and other legal documents.
They tend to document particular towns, including 500 or more documents
each for Vicenza and Fabriano; 100-200 each for Bergamo, Tirano, and Caravaggio;
and scattered documents for Asti, Beneventum, Ferrara, Florence, Venice,
Verona, and many other northern Italian towns. Though the inventory gives
the names of particular towns where the notaries practiced their trade,
the documents themselves may concern the surrounding <i>contado</i> or
other places. The notarial documents include: (1) the original minutes
for legal documents of a contractual nature, such as land conveyances,
prepared by the notaries, filed archivally for future reference by the
notary, and in most cases recorded in notarial protocols or registers;
(2) engrossed personal copies made by notaries for individuals and bearing
later endorsements; and (3) non-contractual documents such as estate inventories
and court judgments.
<p>Perhaps the most important part of the Scheide collection is a substantial
part of the archives of an Italian monastery. The Benedictine (later Silvestrine)
abbey of S. Vittore delle Chiuse was founded in the 10<sup>th</sup> century
on the right bank of the River Sentito, in the hills overlooking Castel
Petroso (now Pierosara), near the town of Fabriano in the March of Ancona.
Dating from 1007 until the beginning of the 15<sup>th</sup> century, the
hundreds of S. Vittore documents now in the Scheide collection had been
taken for safekeeping after 1810 by the monk Benedetto Rosei di Fabriano,
whose heirs sold the material to Leo S. Olschki, who in turn sold them
to William T. Scheide. The S. Vittore archives include notarial documents
retained by the monastery.
<p>French materials account for almost 2,500 items in the Scheide collection,
chiefly the papers of the D'Olive family of Toulouse, whose noble lineage
may be traced back to the mid-15<sup>th</sup> century. The papers were
kept by members of the family for centuries and organized in the latter
half of the 18<sup>th</sup> century by Joseph-Denis d'Olive (d. 1783),
who served as President of the Chambre des Requ&ecirc;tes of the Parlement
of Toulouse. In defense of its landed wealth and seigniorial rights, chiefly
in the villages and manors of Esperce as well as Brugi&egrave;res and others,
the D'Olive family was frequently involved in litigation and retained records
of at least 26 court cases.
<p>Other French archival materials were acquired from the Slade Collection
along with D'Olive Family Papers, including several boxes of French documents
(boxes 156-164) partially identified in Seymour De Ricci, <i>Census of
Medieval and Renaissance Manuscripts in the United States and Canada</i>
(vol. 2, pp. 1822-37) and the 1938 Parke-Bernet auction catalog's description
of the Slade collection (pp. 48-50). Of particular interest in the boxes
are four notarial registers kept between 1382 and 1486 by members of the
Borelli family and other notaries in the small southern French town of
Montech, D&eacute;partment de Tarn-et-Garonne, northwest of Toulouse. Also
of great research value are an account roll (1476) kept in Castres, D&eacute;partment
de Tarn-et-Garonne, by Pierre Bayard, treasurer and counselor to Charles
VIII (1483-98); a 14-page <i>censier</i> or roll of quit-rents (1517) for
the town of Brugi&egrave;res, near Castres; and a 78-page <i>rentier</i>
or rent roll (1562-69) for the manor of Quemper-Gu&eacute;zennec, a village
in the D&eacute;partment des Cotes-du-Nord, Brittany. Found in the same
boxes as the D'Olive Family Papers is a smaller group of notarial documents
from the village of Pont Farcy pertaining to Burguet family and the area
of Avranches in Normandy, dating from the 17<sup>th</sup> and 18<sup>th</sup>
centuries.<font color="#FF0000"> </font>The Scheide Collection also includes
a series of documents (boxes 89-97) that were originally collected around
1887 by a certain Dr. Vaunaire of Gannat, France; these materials pertain
to Roches, Villars, Percenat, Tronget, and other small French towns in
the D&eacute;partment d'Allier.
<p>Finally, John Hinsdale Scheide also included in the collection various
small groups of English documents, many from the collection of Sir Thomas
Phillipps (1792-1872), as well as French, Italian, Flemish, and other items
from the Middle Ages to the 19<sup>th</sup> century.

<a NAME="list"></a><b>Document Listing</b></h3>
<b>The Scheide Documents Database</b>
<p>The Scheide Documents Database consists of 7323 records, each containing
seven fields or elements: <b>item number</b>, <b>date</b>, <b>country</b>,
<b>place
name</b>, <b>type</b>, <b>note</b> and <b>expanded note</b>. The
<b>item
number</b> is the unique key of each record: it is a hybrid of the box
number and document number. "74-2003" means, for example, Box 74 and Document
2003. The <b>date</b> is the year date of the document, often an approximation
due to the differences in calendar years. <b>Country</b> is based on the
modern location of the place name (source or place of origination) of the
document, except that "Papacy" is used as the "country" for all papal documents,
regardless of source. The majority of the documents are from France, England,
Germany, Italy, and Spain. The <b>place name</b> is given, in most cases,
as the modern form of the village, town, or city from where the document
originated. <b>Type</b> indicates the form or genre of the document, such
as legal document, marriage certificate, deed, letter, and will. Additional
descriptive information is provided in the <b>note</b> field, which, if
necessary, spills over into the <b>expanded note</b>.
<p>The following Microsoft Excel version of the database has been sorted
first by country, then by place name and date, in order to facilitate research
about specific geographical places. However, each user can do searches,
sort, and save the records as he or she sees fit.
