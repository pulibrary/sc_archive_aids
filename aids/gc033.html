<br>Consists of wood engravings by Anderson, the first engraver on wood
in America and a follower of Thomas Bewick's white line style. Anderson's
engraved headpieces for the American editions of Arnaud Berqun's <i>The
Looking-Glass for the Mind </i>show his close study and familiarity with
the English artist's techniques, as do the vignettes for Robert Bloomfield's
<i>The Farmer's Boy</i> done in the early 1800s. Illustrations that appeared
in various journals and magazines are also included, as is the diploma
awarded to him from the American Academy of Fine Arts in 1818.
