<h3>
<a NAME="intro"></a><b>Introduction</b></h3>
<font face="Times New Roman">Since 1950, the Princeton University Library
has been successful in acquiring additional manuscripts and related materials
to complement the F. Scott Fitzgerald Papers (C0187). The F. Scott Fitzgerald
Additional Papers (C0188) is comprised of Fitzgerald manuscripts (including
his published juvenilia), letters, documents, photographs, tape recordings,
memorabilia, and other materials donated by the author's family, friends,
and publishers.</font> The F. Scott Fitzgerald Additional Papers is an
open collection to which other Fitzgerald materials, acquired by gift or
purchase, can be added.
<p><u>Range of Collection Dates</u>: 1909-1978
<p><u>Size</u>: 21.0 linear ft. (24 archival boxes, 1 box of tape reels,
1 oversize flat box, 2 oversize folders)
<p><u>Provenance</u>: The collection has developed principally through
gifts from Fitzgerald's friends--Marie Shank and Sheilah Graham in 1959,
Bertie Barr and <i>Esquire</i> magazine in 1962--and a purchase from Laura
Hearne in 1967. In addition, there was a significant, anonymous gift in
1992.
<p><u>Restrictions</u>:<font face="Times New Roman"> There are no closed
or sealed materials in the F. Scott Fitzgerald Additional Papers. However,
for legal or preservation reasons, only microfilm or preservation photocopies
are generally available for certain Fitzgerald materials. Both the F. Scott
Fitzgerald Papers (C0187) and the F. Scott Fitzgerald Additional Papers
(C0188) have been heavily used since 1950, and a substantial portion of
papers has been published and is widely available in research libraries.
Accordingly, potential researchers should understand the relationship of
the papers themselves to information available in print, as here described.</font>
<blockquote><font face="Times New Roman"><u>Manuscripts</u>: Researchers
should be aware that facsimiles of the manuscripts of Fitzgerald's books
and articles were published in the multi-volume series <i>F. Scott Fitzgerald
Manuscripts,</i> edited by Matthew J. Bruccoli and Alan Margolies (New
York: Garland Publishing Company, 1990). Complete sets of the facsimile
edition are available at more than fifty research libraries (including
Firestone Library). The original manuscript of Fitzgerald's ledger is not
at Princeton. One should use <i>F. Scott Fitzgerald's Ledger: A Facsimile,</i>
with an introduction by Matthew J. Bruccoli (Washington, D.C.: NCR/Microcard
Editions, 1972) or refer to the photostats in Box 60 (C0187). With respect
to using Fitzgerald's manuscripts at Princeton, researchers should be aware
that the 1950 deed of gift stipulates that Fitzgerald's manuscripts were
to be microfilmed to preserve the originals, and that researchers must
use the microfilm for most purposes. Researchers who believe that there
are compelling reasons why they must have access to the original manuscripts
instead of the facsimile edition or microfilm must request permission in
advance from the Curator of Manuscripts. Researchers should also be aware
of the <i>Cambridge Edition of the Works of F. Scott Fitzgerald,</i> edited
by James L. W. West III (Cambridge, England, and New York: Cambridge University
Press, 1991- ). Based on Fitzgerald's manuscripts and published editions,
the Cambridge edition will eventually number 17 volumes.</font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font face="Times New Roman"><u>Correspondence</u>: A large
portion of correspondence in the F. Scott Fitzgerald Papers and other collections
at Princeton has been published in critical editions. The following editions
of correspondence (listed alphabetically by editor) can be found in most
research libraries: <i>As Ever Scott Fitz--: Letters between F. Scott Fitzgerald
and His Literary Agent Harold Ober, </i>edited by Matthew J. Bruccoli with
Jennifer Atkinson (Philadelphia: Lippincott, 1972);<i> </i>A <i>Life in
Letters: F. Scott Fitzgerald, </i>edited by Matthew J. Bruccoli with Judith
S. Baughman (New York: Scribner's, 1994); <i>Correspondence of F. Scott
Fitzgerald, </i>edited by Matthew J. Bruccoli and Margaret Duggan with
Susan Walker<i> </i>(New York: Random House, 1980);<i> Dear Scott, Dearest
Zelda: The Love Letters of F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald</i>, edited by
Jackson R. Bryer and Cathy Barks (New York: St. Martin's Press, 2002);<i>
Dear Scott/Dear Max: The Fitzgerald-Perkins Correspondence, </i>edited
by John Kuehl and Jackson R. Bryer (New York: Scribner, 1971); <i>Letters
of F. Scott Fitzgerald</i>, edited by Andrew Turnbull (New York: Scribner,
1963); <i>Scott Fitzgerald: Letters to his Daughter</i>, edited by Andrew
Turnbull with an introduction by Frances Fitzgerald Lanahan (New York:
Scribner, 1965).</font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font face="Times New Roman"><u>Photographs</u>: Photographs
of F. Scott Fitzgerald and Zelda Fitzgerald are very frequently requested
by publishers, newspapers, magazines, and documentary film makers. Researchers
should be aware that the Department of Rare Books and Special Collections
maintains a large file of copy negatives to facilitate reproduction of
these photographs. Most of the photographs in the F. Scott Fitzgerald Papers
and other collections at Princeton were reproduced in <i>The Romantic Egoists:
A Pictorial Autobiography from the Scrapbooks and Albums of Scott and Zelda
Fitzgerald,</i> edited by Matthew J. Bruccoli, Scottie Fitzgerald Smith,
and Joan P. Kerr (New York: Scribner, 1974). Often-requested images can
be viewed online by visiting the Library's RBSC Portfolio at <a href="http://libweb2.princeton.edu/rbsc2/portfolio/portfolio.html">http://libweb2.princeton.edu/rbsc2/portfolio/portfolio.html</a></font></blockquote>
<u>Photocopying, literary rights, and citation</u>: Single photocopies
may be made for research purposes. Most photoduplication will be in form
of duplicate microfilm and photographic prints. Photocopies are not provided
when microfilm exists. Formerly closed materials relating to Zelda Fitzgerald's
illness and hospitalization are not available for photoduplication. No
further photoduplication of copies of material in the collection can be
made when Princeton University Library does not own the original. Permission
to publish material from the collection must be requested from the Associate
University Librarian for Rare Books and Special Collections. The library
has no information on the status of literary rights in the collection and
researchers are responsible for determining any questions of copyright.
The Fitzgerald copyright is owned by the Fitzgerald Literary Trust and
administered by Harold Ober Associates, Inc. Researchers are therefore
advised to address all questions about Fitzgerald literary rights to Harold
Ober Associates Inc., 425 Madison Avenue, New York, New York 10017 (Telephone:&nbsp;
212-759-8600; FAX:&nbsp; 212-759-9428). Publication, reproduction, and
broadcast of the image of F. Scott Fitzgerald and Zelda Fitzgerald involve
additional rights owned by the Fitzgerald Literary Trust and administered
by Harold Ober Associates, Inc. Citations should be as follows:&nbsp; F.
Scott Fitzgerald Additional Papers, Box #, Folder #, Department of Rare
Books and Special Collections, Princeton University Library.
<p><u>Conservation Note</u>: <font face="Times New Roman">In May 1999,
the Princeton University Library was awarded a federal grant under the
"Save America's Treasures" program, administered by the National Endowment
for the Humanities (NEH), to deacidify, repair, and rehouse the F. Scott
Fitzgerald Papers. Work was completed in August 2001.</font>
<p><u>Microfilm Note</u>: Due to additional microfilming in the summer
of 2001, as well as the rehousing of the collection, some of the microfilm
box numbers may not correspond to the manuscript box numbers listed in
"A Guide to Microfilm for F. Scott Fitzgerald Papers." The "Guide" will
be revised and updated as soon as possible.&nbsp;

<h3>
<a NAME="bio"></a><b>Biographical Sketch</b></h3>
F(rancis) Scott (Key) Fitzgerald (1896-1940), novelist, poet, playwright,
screenwriter, author of short stories, was born in St. Paul, Minnesota.
He entered Princeton University in 1913 as an undergraduate, and joined
the famous Princeton Triangle Club, for which he wrote the scripts and
lyrics for various shows. However, he withdrew from Princeton in January,
1916, ostensibly because of his health, though in reality for bad grades.
He returned to the University in 1917, but never graduated, opting to serve
in the army to fight in World War I, from 1917-1919. During this time,
while stationed at Camp Sheridan in Montgomery, Alabama, he met Zelda Sayre,
a writer, artist, and dancer. They married on April 3, 1920, a week after
Fitzgerald's first novel, <i>This Side of Paradise</i>, was published.
<p>Fitzgerald went on to publish three more novels in his lifetime: <i>The
Beautiful and Damned</i> (1922), <i>The Great Gatsby</i> (1925), and <i>Tender
Is the Night: A Romance</i> (1934). His last, and unfinished, novel, <i>The
Last Tycoon</i>, was published posthumously in 1941. Besides his novels,
Fitzgerald also wrote numerous articles and short stories, which were published
in such magazines as <i>The Saturday Evening Post</i> and <i>Esquire</i>.
He also worked as a screenwriter in Hollywood, first with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer
(he had a hand in writing the script for <i>Gone with the Wind</i>), then
as a freelancer for other studios. In Hollywood, he met Sheilah Graham,
a film columnist. They had a relationship which was, at times, stormy,
due to Fitzgerald's alcohol-abuse problem. He died at her apartment in
Hollywood of a sudden heart attack on December 21, 1940.
