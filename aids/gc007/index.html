Consists of Darley drawings in pencil, pen-and-ink, and wash, most of which
are sketches for unidentified books and magazines, though there are some
illustrations for published books by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Washington
Irving, James Fenimore Cooper, Lawrence Lovechild, and Charles Dickens.
There are 14 pieces of juvenilia: the earliest is a scribble done when
he was six years old; a year later, his drawing of a teddy bear already
shows artistic precociousness. Included are some drawings for banknotes,
which are distinguished by the rural character of such vignettes as one
in the collection entitled "Bull at the haystack." His lighter vein is
exemplified by such drawings as his gentle jab at the world adulation of
the dancer Fanny Elssler (1810-1884) and his sketch of an armored fisherman
after the style of John Flaxman. In contrast are three somber and realistic
Civil War drawings.
